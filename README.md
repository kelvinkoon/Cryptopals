## Cryptopals Solutions
[Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) is a set of exercises for learning about cryptography.

Implementations are written in Python3. Exercises which do not provide an expected answer are replaced with the SHA1 hash of the correct solution.

### Running Tests
Tests were written using the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) framework. To execute the tests, run `pytest` from the root directory.

### Dependencies
Full list of dependencies can be found in `requirements.txt`. Dependencies can be installed (preferably with a virtual environment) through `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
